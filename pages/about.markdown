I am a tech entrepreneur and software engineer. I am the co-founder of [Sablier](https://sablier.com), the project that
has pioneered the concept of [money streaming](https://docs.sablier.com/concepts/protocol/streaming) on Ethereum.

My open-source contributions can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/PaulRBerg) profile.

Outside work, I am interested in longevity, philosophy, and physics.

Some thinkers I admire: David Deutsch, David Wallace, Karl Popper, Naval Ravikant, Vitalik Buterin, and Nick Szabo.
