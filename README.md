# PaulRBerg.github.io

I use this GitHub Pages site to host my presentations.

## Domain

The canonical domain name for this site is [prberg.com](https://prberg.com), but you can also access it via
[paulrberg.github.io](https://paulrberg.github.io).

## Jekyll

GitHub Pages uses Jekyll for building websites from repository contents. By default, Jekyll excludes certain files from
the build process, such as files and folders that start with a dot (`.`) or an underscore (`_`).

For guidance on how to exclude more files, see my
[conversation with ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/ebb35efe-114f-4924-a15e-d68db3733163).
